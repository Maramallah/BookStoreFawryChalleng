- ISBN (String identifier)
- Title
- Publication Year
- Price

**Key Methods:**
- `isOutdated()`: Checks if book is over 100 years old
- `IsForBuying()`: Abstract method to determine if book can be purchased
- `BuyBook()`: Abstract method for purchase logic

#### `Purchasable` (Interface)
Interface for books that can be bought:
- `sendToPurchaseService()`: Handles delivery service integration

#### Book Types

1. **`Paperbook`**
   - Extends `Book`, implements `Purchasable`
   - Has stock quantity
   - Reduces stock on purchase
   - Sends to ShippingService

2. **`EBook`**
   - Extends `Book`, implements `Purchasable`
   - Has file type (PDF, EPUB, etc.)
   - Has stock quantity
   - Sends to MailService

3. **`ShowcaseBook`**
   - Extends `Book`
   - Display-only, cannot be purchased
   - Throws exception if purchase attempted

#### `OnlineStore`
Main application class with console interface:
- Book inventory management
- User interaction handling

## üîß Code Structure

```
org.example/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Book.java              # Abstract base class
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Purchasable.java       # Interface for purchasable books
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Paperbook.java         # Physical book implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EBook.java             # Digital book implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ShowcaseBook.java      # Display-only book implementation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ OnlineStore.java       # Main application & UI
```

## üé® Design Patterns Used

1. **Template Method Pattern**: `Book` class defines common structure
2. **Strategy Pattern**: Different book types implement different purchasing strategies
3. **Interface Segregation**: `Purchasable` interface only for buyable books
4. **Polymorphism**: All books treated uniformly through `Book` reference

## üß™ Testing

The application includes basic error handling:
- Stock validation for paper books and ebooks
- Invalid input validation
- Showcase book purchase prevention
- Outdated book detection

### Test Cases to Verify

1. **Add Books**: Test adding all three book types
2. **Stock Management**: Buy books and verify stock reduction
3. **Error Handling**: Try buying showcase books or exceeding stock
4. **Outdated Books**: Add old books and test removal
5. **Invalid Input**: Test with wrong menu choices and book types

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Add customer accounts
- **Order History**: Track purchase history
- **Search Functionality**: Find books by title/author
- **Inventory Reports**: Generate stock reports
- **Database Integration**: Persist data between sessions
- **GUI Interface**: Replace console with graphical interface

## üìù Notes
